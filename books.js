They were going fishing, kite flying, and bird-watching with Willimena's dad. What could be more fun! But then it happened. Everything began to revolve around Teddy. It was \"Teddy this . . .\" and \"Teddy that . . .\" and \"Teddy is so good at everything!\" On the day of the family fishing trip, Willie was determined to capture the spotlight and catch more fish than anyone-especially Teddy. So, when Teddy caught the only fish of the day, Willimena put down her pole-and began fishing for trouble. And she didn't have to go far. Teddy was her bait.",

In it, Boyd examines the perceptions that young people may have of the Vietnam War, as well as the impact that the war and the homefront divisiveness of the war era continue to have on families, especially those in which there are veterans. Chartreuse ``Charlie'' Pippin is an 11-year-old black girl living in Berkeley, California. Not much seems to go right for her. She is a hardworking, successful businesswoman cut from the same delightful, rebellious cloth as her grandmother, but her entrepreneurial skills cause her problems with both her father and school authorities. Her decision to learn about the Vietnam War as a school report only leads to further conflict with her father, who refuses to discuss the war. The domestic resolution is in keeping with the larger issue of the war: it is not so much a peace settlement as a cease fire.  From School Library Journal",

Intended to provide this frequently regarded \"lost generation\" of young men with words of encouragement and guidance, Harper's deep-rooted passion regarding the plight of today's youth drove him to write this book, sure to change the lives of readers for years to come.",

D comes from a world vastly different from their safe Queens neighborhood, and through her, the girls see another side of life that includes loss, foster families and an amount of freedom that makes the girls envious. Although all of them are crazy about Tupac Shakur's rap music, D is the one who truly understands the place where he's coming from, and through knowing D, Tupac's lyrics become more personal for all of them. \n\nThe girls are thirteen when D's mom swoops in to reclaim D?and as magically as she appeared, she now disappears from their lives. Tupac is gone, too, after another shooting; this time fatal. As the narrator looks back, she sees lives suspended in time, and realizes that even all-too-brief connections can touch deeply.",

  "description": "When a high school teacher in the Bronx begins to host open-mike poetry in his classroom on Fridays, his students find a forum to express their identity issues and forge unexpected connections with one another. Grimes's (Jazmin's Notebook) creative, contemporary premise will hook teens, and the poems may even inspire readers to try a few of their own. The poetic forms range from lyrics penned by aspiring rapper Tyrone to the concrete poem of a budding Puerto Rican painter Raul (titled \"Zorro\" and formed as the letter \"Z\"). Ultimately, though, there may be too many characters for the audience to penetrate deeply. The students in Mr. Ward's English class experience everything from dyslexia and low self-esteem to teenage motherhood and physical abuse. The narrators trade off quickly, offering only a glimpse into their lives. Not even Tyrone, who breaks in after each student's poem to offer some commentary, comes fully to life.

  "description": "14-year-old Lily Owen, neglected by her father and isolated on their South Carolina peach farm, spends hours imagining a blissful infancy when she was loved and nurtured by her mother, Deborah, whom she barely remembers. These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words \"Tiburon, South Carolina\" scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed, The Secret Life of Bees is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic.

And he had a dream.\r\n\r\nLiving in the segregated South of the 1920's, where most people were sharecroppers. Uncle Jed had to travel all over the county to cut his customers' hair. He lived for the day when he could open his very own barbershop. But it was a long time, and many setbacks, from five-year-old Sarah Jean's emergency operation to the bank failures of the Great Depression, before the joyful day when Uncle Jed opened his shiny new shop ? and twirled a now grown-up Sarah Jean around in the barber chair.",

After calling on her mental and spiritual reserves, Williams patiently worked on the girl?s hair, ultimately giving her Senegalese twists.

  "description": "For Betty, winning now means swimming upward from the depths of near-death. In the cold hum of the hospital only Keisha can remember their dreams from earlier that summer, when she was to attend a premed vacation school at nearby Avery University. Keisha dreamed of being a doctor. Betty dreamed desperately of having a friend.\n\nThey were both at risk -- at least that's the label Keisha gets slapped with when, instead of Avery, she is sent to an urban rescue program for teens in poverty, or, as she figures it, born in sin. She is outraged, but she turns anger into something much more powerful -- the will to prove her doubters wrong. For this she has friends, family, and one ally especially -- Malik, Betty's watchful brother, who wants beauty to be there for everyone. Keisha's story is part drama, part victory lap,...and all heart.",

The year is 1948, the last year of the Negro Leagues, and the book offers not just one boy's experiences and growth but also an appreciation of the trials and triumphs of black ballplayers, particularly in the South. Biddy's episodic story takes readers from his home, where economic troubles strain relations, to the road, where a remark like \"We don't serve no nigras here\" is commonplace to the ballparks of America, in which the playing field is generally level (if a little rocky). The book has two other notable aspects. First, the writing is infused with a love of baseball that is never sappy. And second, this novel clearly portrays the ongoing racial prejudice of the era without making that the focus of the story.",

Rescued from a series of foster homes and makeshift living arrangements by her older sister, CeCe, Jazmin draws strength and wisdom from her devoted sibling when their alcoholic mother is institutionalized. Jazmin is an observer and a thinker. From her apartment stoop, she savors the rhythm and blues that drifts out of the Garden of Eden Bar & Grill next door and watches customers come and go. At school, she avoids a fight by locking herself in the bathroom and scribbling her anger in verse. When a high-school guidance counselor suggests pursuing a vocational career, Jazmin clings to her aspirations of being a writer and demands a college-prep schedule. Despite her \"second hand\" appearance, the girl's goals are high and her attitude is positive. The sadness in her life comes from watching her gentle father die after a car crash and being unable to connect with her troubled, aloof mother. However, Jazmin is resilient.

When he wasn't toting baggage at the depot (that's how he earned money and the nickname \"Satchel\"), he was pitching. His coach at school told him, \"You concentrate on baseball, and you might make something of yourself.\"\n\nAnd that he did. Satchel Paige developed his own pitches (he even named them!) and a unique pitching style, complete with a grin he flashed as he released the ball. Fans packed the stands to see how many batters he could strike out in one game. They loved his confidence, his fast-talking, and the way he followed his own rules.\n\nAfter just one year in the semi-pros Satch was playing in the Negro major leagues. He went on to become the first African American to pitch in a major league World Series, and the first black to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. By the time he died in 1982, he had enjoyed one of the longest and brightest careers in baseball history.",

Her grandmother has prepared her well, fortifying her \"with enough love, respect, and pride to overcome any situation.\" 'Tricia Ann, though frustrated by the Jim Crow laws that forbid her, as an African American, to enter certain restaurants and hotels, or even to sit on park benches marked \"For Whites Only,\" rises above her pain and makes her way to one of the only places in the city that welcomes her with open arms: the public library.

Their first stroke of luck was testing into University High, one of Newark's three magnet high schools, and their second was finding each other. They were busy staying out of trouble (most of the time), and discovering the usual ways to skip class and do as little schoolwork as possible, when a recruitment presentation on Seton Hall University reignited George's childhood dream of becoming a dentist. The college was offering a tempting assistance package for minorities in its Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Plus Program. George convinced his two friends to go to college with him. They would help each other through. None of them would be allowed to drop out and be reabsorbed by the Newark streets. Amazon.com Review",

  "description": "A contemporary retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story with a happy, upbeat ending. Sixteen-year-old Julio Montague's parents have moved their family to Cincinnati, OH, in order to get their son out of his gang-ridden high school in Corpus Christi, TX. Romiette Cappelle, also 16, is the daughter of successful African-American parents and the granddaughter of college professors. When these two young people, both from proud heritages, begin a romance, they must deal not only with their parents' prejudices but also with the threats of a local gang called The Family. At times, Romiette and Julio effectively parallels and contemporizes the original story. The young couple meet, not at the Capulets' feast, but in an Internet chat room. Julio's friend, Ben Olsen (read Benvolio), who looks like a punk rocker, has an optimistic and irreverent attitude that balances Julio's passion and volatility. At other times, the allusions to the play are obvious and heavy-handed. Nonetheless, this novel is more than simply a carefully plotted teenage romance. From School Library Journal",

Narrator Frannie is fascinated with Emily Dickinson's poem, \"Hope is the thing with feathers/ that perches in the soul,\" and grapples with its meaning, especially after a white student joins Frannie's all-black sixth-grade classroom. Trevor, the classroom bully, promptly nicknames him \"Jesus Boy,\" because he is \"pale and his hair [is] long.\" Frannie's best friend, Samantha, a preacher's daughter, starts to believe that the new boy truly could be Jesus (\"If there was a world for Jesus to need to walk back into, wouldn't this one be it?\"). The Jesus Boy's sense of calm and its effect on her classmates make Frannie wonder if there is some truth to Samantha'a musings, but a climactic faceoff between him and Trevor bring the newcomer's human flaws to light. Frannie's keen perceptions allow readers to observe a ripple of changes. Because she has experienced so much sadness in her life (her brother's deafness, her mother's miscarriages) the heroine is able to see beyond it all?to look forward to a time when the pain subsides and life continues.

Author Sharon Draper helped shape chapters, written in the third person, describing each doctor's challenging childhood experiences, including a parent's drug addiction, forays into crime, and succeeding in an environment that made \"failing equal to being cool.\" Following each story, passages written in the doctors' own words offer advice and strategies, and acknowledge the help received along the way. This information is directed straight to young people growing up in similar circumstances, but all readers will be riveted by the profoundly inspirational stories and personal, intimate voices that frankly discuss big mistakes and complicated emotions, including \"survivor guilt\" for choosing a different path from friends and family.

A lover of stories, Grace longs for a family like the ones she reads about in her books. She has a secure and happy home with her ma, her nana, and her cat, but feels she's missed out by not having a father, a brother, and a dog. Her own father moved to Africa after her parents' divorce and began a new family there. One day her mother surprises her with the news that her dad has sent tickets for Grace and Nana to come for a visit. Arriving in The Gambia, she finds the storybook family she's been looking for, but it doesn't seem to include her. \"'I'm one girl too many. Besides, it's the wrong Ma,'\" she says. Jatou doesn't fit the model of any of the stepmothers Grace has read about, but she promises her father she'll try to like the woman since they are both so important to him. Through the wonderful visit and getting to know her stepfamily Grace learns to embrace life even when it isn't picture perfect. Luann Toth, School Library Journal",

Gathered from children as well as the elderly, these chants can still be heard in schoolyards all over the islands, from Jamaica to Martinique to the Dutch West Indies.

Pawpaws and breadfruit, guava and calaloo-stew give the verses an exotic feel, while girls jumping rope and boys \"peltin' stones in a tree\" set them within a familiar context.

  "description": "This beginning chapter book finds Grace and her friends at the start of summer vacation ready for new adventures, and that's just what they get. From circus performers to ghostbusters, from astronauts to detectives, the child and her \"gang of four\" always find something exciting to play. What makes this episodic tale work particularly well are the plot twists in each chapter. For instance, when the girl and her pals decide to investigate the \"haunted house\" in the neighborhood, they meet a timid old woman whose wartime escape from Europe years before has left her frightened of leaving her home. There are misadventures, too-as when Grace decides to spy on her mother's boyfriend and gets caught. Still, all's well that ends well, and as the summer draws to a close, Grace and company get to perform on a real stage. Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, School Library Journal",

His love of the game provides the impetus for the story. Little Dolly's 90th birthday is approaching and Kenyon has saved his money to buy her a gift. Before he can make a decision about it, however, he sees the perfect baseball glove?and he buys it. Now he must grapple with his conscience, and with not having a present for Little Dolly.

When Mufaro receives word that the Great King is inviting all of the most worthy and beautiful women to appear before him so that he might choose a wife, Mufaro decides that both of his daughters should go. Manyara, believing herself more worthy and beautiful than her sister, sets out alone so that she can be presented to the king before her sister.

On a scorching hot Mississippi day, a little girl walks into town by herself to learn whether it really is possible to fry an egg on the sidewalk. Mission accomplished, she is on her way home when she stops for a drink of water. Interpreting the \"whites only\" sign on the water fountain to refer to socks, the African American child takes off her patent-leather shoes and has just begun to drink when an angry white man grabs her and pushes her to the ground. He threatens to \"whup\" her, but the black townspeople come to the girl's aid by taking off their shoes and drinking from the same fountain.

Homesick Blues shows a saxophone player conjuring up a locomotive at a railroad station. Harlem features a line of people waiting at a bus stop. A poignant rendering of a child watching from outside the fence surrounding a carousel accompanies Merry-Go-Round. For I, Too, a jubilant man leaps, arms and legs stretched out, and for Dream Variations, a man is poised on tiptoe, arms outstretched with the word DREAMS dripping from his fingertips into a heap on the floor. A four-page introduction tells about Hughes's life, setting the context for the poems that follow. Each selection includes a brief introduction, many recounting Hughes's own thoughts about it, and footnotes explain dialect and historical terms such as Jim Crow.  From School Library Journal",

The neighborhood children join the Robinson kids for swimming and boating. But oddly, Jackie never goes near the water. In a dramatic episode that first winter, the children beg to go ice skating on the lake. Jackie says they can go--but only after he tests the ice to make sure it's safe. The children prod and push to get Jackie outside, until hesitantly, he finally goes. Like a blind man with a stick, Jackie taps on the ice's surface, when suddenly howling and roaring sounds come out of the lake! It is only then that Sharon realizes why she's never seen her father in the water -- Jackie doesn't know how to swim! But her horror changes to relief as Jackie bravely taps his way to the middle of the lake -- and declare it safe! In a stunning metaphor for Jackie Robinson's legendary breaking of the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Sharon Robinson honors her extraordinary father's memory with her warm graceful storytelling. Two-time Caldecott Honor Book artist Kadir Nelson has created richly rendered paintings that radiate with the beauty and spirit of one of America's finest heroes. From Amazon.com",

Having been in love with the sport since she attended a game at Madison Square Garden, she's anxious to test her skills with her new ball. Her father walks her to a park where she shoots a few hoops with little success. As time goes by, Allie runs into friends and acquaintances who decline to join her on the court, some even commenting that they thought basketball was \"for boys.\" Undaunted, the girl begins to find the range of her shot, and those who previously scoffed at her efforts begin to take notice.

Although little light is shed on his personal life or personality, the performer's devotion to his craft and his dedication to portraying the African-American experience through dance are thoroughly explored. One chapter focuses on his masterpiece, Revelations, which utilizes various genres of dance, including ballet and traditional African styles, and has become a classic of American dance. The book also details Ailey's relationships with friends and colleagues, like Maya Angelou and Judith Jamison, who took the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater after his death in 1989.

Yes, says the narrator of this resonant picture book, which uses the peculiar logic of dreams to take the reader beyond straight biography into a more personal, heartfelt interpretation of King's legacy. In a dream, the narrator sees King as a boy experiencing both the well-known incidents of his childhood and those of his early adult life. Dream logic makes this switch not only acceptable but reasonable, suggesting the childhood roots of the man's concerns. The dream changes again: King, now shown as an adult, presides over the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and, in his great speech in Washington, proclaims his dream.

For several pages, a child named Montsho asks his beloved grandfather about dark, scary nights, black eyes, black cats that bring bad luck, black as the color of mourning, negative stereotypes on television--and close to home, about why his aunt calls him the \"black sheep of the family\" because he is darker than his brothers. Grandpa hugs him close, beats a great African drum, and tells Montsho that black is beautiful. Handsome double-page spreads acclaim the history, spirit, and culture of Montsho's African heritage: \"Africa is beautiful and so are its people with their beautiful, dark black skin.\"  From Booklist",

From an early age, she was aware of the tensions of racism that divided American society. Her father was party to a major Supreme Court case, Hansberry v.

She studied briefly at the University of Wisconsin but left for the livelier confines of New York City in the early 1950s, where she wrote for Freedom, a monthly commentary founded by Robeson. She married Robert Nemiroff and began to write the play that became A Raisin in the Sun, and that work, of course, went on to make dramatic history.  From Booklist",

  "description": "Thomas's is probably one of the two or three best books about professional basketball ever read by this reviewer. The compelling narrative will hold every reader's interest. Although the current National Basketball Association (NBA) is over 80 percent black, African Americans did not enter the league until 1950. Yet even the most dedicated NBA fan would be hard-pressed to identify such pioneers as Harold Hunter (the first black player to sign an NBA contract), Earl Lloyd (the first black to play in an NBA game), and Chuck Cooper (the first to be drafted by an NBA team). The book describes their trials and triumphs and then more briefly traces the rise of the black athlete as a force in the league. It was not easy, as there were official and unofficial \"quotas,\" and local harassment could make traveling with the teams a real ordeal. This book is important not just for basketball fans but for those who want to understand the role played by African Americans in the development of the NBA and big-time sports today.

Each year, a straw beater is selected--a young boy who stands behind the fiddler with a pair of straws to beat the fiddle strings like a drum. The means of selection is a wrestling match. Seven-year-old Jess is determined to triumph over Nathaniel, who's always been chosen as straw beater. But Nathaniel is twice Jess' size, and the odds seem a mite slim. On the big night, Jess is thrown twice, and Sis Wisa, Jess' mom who watches from the sidelines, winces. But it's not over till it's over, and in one last-ditch effort, Jess grabs Nathaniel and hangs on for all he's worth.

However, when Mbi causes the tree to grow into the clouds with a mean boy trapped at the top, the people heap gifts, flattery, and promises of good treatment on him until he brings the boy down.

  "description": "A warm family story set in Tanzania in the 1960s. Saruni is a picture of determination as he learns to ride his father's big bicycle and saves his small earnings to buy one of his own in order to help his mother deliver her goods to market. After months of work, he takes his coins to the bicycle seller, who adds them up and responds with humiliating laughter. However, Saruni is rewarded when his father buys a motorbike and \"sells\" his old bicycle to his son. In the end, Saruni's parents refuse his payment, preferring to give him the bike as a reward for his help. At story's end, he is again saving his coins-this time to buy a cart to pull behind his bicycle and further lighten his mother's load. From School Library Journal",

But when beloved Coach Spangler  moves up to lead the high-school team and his replacement has a difficult time gaining the Eagles? trust, the team falls apart. Cody?s transformation seems too quick and easy, but the gradually mounting tension between Tiki and Ronde is entirely believable, and so is its resolution. Meanwhile, football fans will find the on-field action scenes and even the coaching sessions very readable.",

  "description": "A couple who longs for a child; a mysterious \"long ago\" world of dangerous, unthinkable oppression and resuscitating natural forces; the emergence of a beatific girl child who must be spirited away before the evil antagonist can get her--all of these traditional fairytale plot elements are reinvented with distinction and life in Faith Ringgold's brand new African American \"legend\" The Invisible Princess. Most important, the title character in this conflict between a community of slaves and their evil plantation owner is instantly magical, and unforgettable. Born on a thunderous, stormy night, bearing saucer-shaped eyes and a burst of cornrows that extend from her head like sun rays, the enchanted Invisible Princess is so magnificently conceived that it makes the ensuing drama--which becomes almost biblical in its proportions--both gripping and conceptually possible.

  "description": "Tar Beach is a work of modern art translated into a children's picture book, and the adaptation is so natural that it seems inevitable. From her 1988 story quilt, reproduced on the cover and within the last pages of the book, Ringgold has taken both the setting and the text. The painted scene in the center of the quilt shows a Harlem rooftop on a starry night with four adults playing cards and with Cassie Louise Lightfoot and her brother, Be Be, lying on a blanket gazing at the sky. Cassie sees herself flying over the city lights; dreams of wearing the George Washington Bridge as a necklace; imagines giving her father the union building he is not allowed to join because of his half-black, half-Indian heritage; flies over the ice cream factory; and takes her little brother with her to the sky.

Cassie, who misses the train, must follow, living the slave existence, always one step behind, hoping to rejoin her brother in Canada.

She reluctantly leaves her Brooklyn home for unfamiliar surroundings, apprehensive about being one of only five African American students at the school. She soon meets three older African American enrollees, who boast of their affluent backgrounds and isolate her from the other girls--including Pauli, the offspring of a mixed marriage, whom they detest for \"assimilating.\" Maizon resents such manipulation, and the trio consequently shuns her. Erecting a shield against further hurt, the girl becomes achingly lonely. Maizon senses she's an oddity at the essentially all-white Blue Hill and in her frank and engaging narrative admits to resisting the place, where racial insults are often seen in innocuous remarks--yet in fact only the three African American girls indulge in obviously bigoted comments.

Everything and everyone goes on and on.? But Sarah feels very sad and alone, even though Grandma and all the relatives are with her, sharing stories and hugs. How can everything go on without Grandpa? Then as summer slips into fall, Grandma and Sarah share a rich garden harvest -- and share their sweet, sweet memories of Grandpa. The stories and memories of loved ones, Sarah learns, are what keep everything and everyone going on and on. In this lyrical text, Jacqueline Woodson balances sadness and mourning with the comforting notion of the continuity of all life. \nFrom Hyperionbooksforchildren.com",

But best of all, twenty-three-year-old Jonathan Hathaway, the new track coach and the principal's son, has his golden eyes set on Keisha Montgomery.\n\nIn her senior year of high school, still recovering from the suicide of her ex-boyfriend, Keisha's thrilled to have someone treat her like a woman rather than a girl. As Jonathan tells her, she's a butterfly ready to try her wings ? much too mature for high school boys, whose only deep thoughts are words from rap songs. Jonathan makes her feel alive again; he seems like the answer to all her dreams and the cure to all her nightmares.\n\nGifts wrapped with silver ribbons begin to mysteriously appear on her doorstep, and Keisha is swept off her feet. But events take a terrifying turn, and suddenly darkness overwhelms her life.... As Keisha struggles to put her world back in perspective, she learns the power and the danger of silence, and discovers the secret gifts that had been waiting for her all along.\nFrom BarnesandNoble.com",

But these strangers are not here to celebrate. They are here to capture the strongest, healthiest villagers and to murder the rest. They are slave traders. And in the time it takes a gun to fire, Amari's life as she knows it is destroyed, along with her family and village.\nBeaten, branded, and dragged onto a slave ship, Amari is forced to witness horrors worse than any nightmare and endure humiliations she had never thought possible--including being sold to a plantation owner in the Carolinas who gives her to his sixteen-year-old son, Clay, as his birthday present.\nfrom sharondraper.com",

Possessed with a marvelous imagination as well as a strong flair for the dramatic, she acts the stories out, always giving herself the most exciting parts. Thus, it is natural when her teacher announces a classroom production of Peter Pan , that Grace wants to play the lead. One classmate says she can't because she's a girl and another says she can't because she's black. When a saddened Grace relates the days events to her mother and grandmother, they tell her she can be anything she wants to, if she puts her mind to it. Inspired by her family's support, her own indomitable spirit, and an excursion to a weekend ballet starring a lovely Trinidadian dancer, Grace shines during her audition, leaving no doubt in anyone's mind as to who will play Peter Pan.

  "description": "Teenagers Ishmael and Sam introduce themselves and relate their parallel problems with their fathers. Abraham is exiling Ishmael, son of his Second Wife, now that elderly Sarah has finally had a son. Sam's dad has left Sam's mother for a younger white woman. In Book One, Ishmael's poems express his pain, confusion, and love: Half Chaldean./Half Egyptian./Half slave./Half free./Half loved./Half hated./Half blessed./All me. His story is set against the background of nomadic desert life, always in the context of God's relations with, and plans for, him. Book Two gives present-day Brooklynite Sam his say: black man breaks/black woman's heart/to marry white witch. He's angry at his father, baffled by his mother, and resistant to his stepmother's friendly overtures. Luckily he has friends and faith; prayer and a kiss from a potential girlfriend provide some peace. The biggest obstacle turns out to be the biggest help: his dad's new son worms his way into his half-brother's heart. Books Three and Four continue the first-person accounts: Abraham's second son is clearly his favorite, and Sarah (a witch here) withdraws her love from Ishmael. Anger and jealousy threaten Ishmael's relations with his father and with God. Sam's father leaves him disillusioned and betrayed. The cross-play is effective, though Sam's story is more vivid and engaging. From School Library Journal",

Grimes's carefully crafted word placement matches the rhythms and messages of the poems. In \"Stroll,\" words are offset from the left margin, symbolizing the protagonist's individual pace, which is unique and different from that of her mother.

This particular story focuses on the journey of one group of runaways who travel according to the directions of the song to reach the Ohio River, where Peg Leg Joe himself is waiting with a boat. Dramatic full-color paintings and a simple text make this part of U.S. history accessible to young readers.   From School Library Journal",

It focuses on one of the most dramatic events in his life: the moment when, as a slave, he summoned up the strength to stand up to his white overseer. Douglass abhorred slavery, but could find no way to escape; yet he was unable to bring himself to accept his situation. He had learned to read, but this knowledge only set him apart from his fellow slaves, and added to his discontent. Miller's narrative is movingly rendered, allowing readers to experience the dilemma facing the young man.  From School Library Journal",

Joshua loves when his uncle teaches him to play the kalimba, but when his family encourages him to perform in the school talent show, he knows he'll be embarrassed because his classmates prefer rap. Sure enough, when the children see Joshua's instrument at rehearsal, they laugh and call his uncle names. When he tells his uncle what happened, the man gives him three very important gifts-a bright colored dashiki, a beautiful new hand-carved kalimba, and a big ostrich-feather mask from the Masai tribe of Kenya. He tells the boy that \"'The mask will listen to everything you say, and you must be careful to speak wisely.'\" When Joshua puts it on, he learns that he can become someone different by simply wishing, and in the end- wishing only to be himself-he is a hit in the show.

Then, in Jackson Square, he hears the great Smilin' Jack playing his trumpet. On the third day, the musician notices the boy's demeanor and asks what's wrong. Upon hearing about Sonny's situation, Smilin' Jack comes up with a solution: they will throw a rent party to raise the money and he will play his horn. The affair is an overwhelming success, and the trumpeter decides to \"play at least one rent party\" wherever he goes. Sonny realizes that problems can be solved when people work together.

He borrows the library card of a white co-worker and goes to the library with a forged note requesting permission to check out books for the man. The librarian treats him with suspicion, until Richard claims to be illiterate. This final act of self-deprecation elicits laughs from the librarian and other patrons.  From School Library Journal",

  "description": "For eight-year-old Paris Richmond, home was such a funny word. Because she and her older brother had moved from one foster home to another so often, it had come to mean not a place but a person. Malcolm was the one constant in her life. When they run away from an abusive home, they seek refuge with their grandmother, who returns them to the foster-care system. It is then that the siblings are placed in separate homes. Though Paris desperately misses Malcolm during her year with the Lincoln family, she gradually comes to trust them and even her own instincts. She gains coping skills through a newfound religious faith and the talent to share it through music. Her ability to keep God in her pocket allows her to overcome fears and difficulty. Her convictions allow her to endure inexcusable prejudice and malice as well as recognize the beauty and kindness around her.   From School Library Journal",

Samuel, the 11-year-old slave who narrates the story, is awakened by 70-year-old Harrison, who has decided to flee their tyrannical Kentucky master. The questions that immediately flood the boy's mind provide the tension that propels the novel: What has precipitated the old man's sudden desire for freedom? Why would he risk taking Samuel along? Harrison is mindful of the dangers and wary of trusting even the strangers who might offer help. Samuel, an impulsive boy who seems prone to trouble, is grudgingly accustomed to his life of servitude and reluctant to leave it. As days of hiding and nights of stealthy movement take them farther away from their former lives, Harrison and Samuel forge a bond that strengthens their resolve. Faith, luck, and perseverance see the man and boy safely into Canada, where a new journey-one of self-discovery and self-healing-begins.  From School Library Journal",

Starting in her own backyard, Maathai planted trees and encouraged other women to do the same. More than 30 million trees have since been planted by the members of her Green Belt Movement.

Before he was Hammerin? Hank, Henry Aaron was a young boy growing up in Mobile, Alabama, with what seemed like a foolhardy dream: to be a big-league baseball player. He didn?t have a bat. He didn?t have a ball. And there wasn?t a single black ball player in the major leagues. But none of this could stop Henry Aaron. In a captivating biography of Henry Aaron?s young life ? from his sandlot days through his time in the Negro Leagues to the day he played his first spring training game for the Braves ?

His very first boxing coach, former police officer Joe Martin, told him, \"You better learn how to fight before you start challenging people.\" Once considered the underdog, Cassius, later known as Muhammad Ali, would eventually win the title of heavyweight champion of the world. Acclaimed author Walter Dean Myers recounts the champ's most famous fights and examines the depth and complexity of the larger-than-life legend Muhammad Ali.

  "description": "A gentle, thoughtful story of a young African-American boy's discovery of the power of words. Each time a word strikes Donavan as special (e.g., extraterrestrial, orchestral, perseverance, boisterous), he writes it down on a slip of paper and puts it in a jar. When his collection no longer fits in its container, he asks several people (Mom, his teacher, Dad, Grandma) what to do, but in a serendipitous way comes upon the solution himself. While visiting his Grandma, the other senior citizens in her building find that reading the words they pull from the jar is just what they need to cheer them up, and Donavan realizes the pleasure of sharing. While this book is not a fast-paced page-turner, the 10 chapters are short, and an appealing black-and-white illustration appears in each one. This title builds readers' vocabulary in a palatable way, and could be used in conjunction with a lesson on using the dictionary.  -From School Library Journal",

  "description": "Set in New York City at the beginning of the American Revolution, Chains addresses the price of freedom both for a nation and for individuals. Isabel tells the story of her life as a slave. She was sold with her five-year-old sister to a cruel Loyalist family even though the girls were to be free upon the death of their former owner. She has hopes of finding a way to freedom and becomes a spy for the rebels, but soon realizes that it is difficult to trust anyone. She chooses to find someone to help her no matter which side he or she is on. With short chapters, each beginning with a historical quote, this fast-paced novel reveals the heartache and struggles of a country and slave fighting for freedom. The characters are well developed, and the situations are realistic. An author's note gives insight into issues surrounding the Revolutionary War and the fight for the nation's freedom even though 20 percent of its people were in chains. Well researched and affecting in its presentation, the story offers readers a fresh look at the conflict and struggle of a developing nation.  From School Library Journal",

  "description": "After his father dies, Kojo quits school to help his mother collect firewood to sell, but there is little money or food. However, his small Ashanti village has elected to try microlending, a system where the village loans money to one family to buy something that will hopefully improve their lives; once it is paid back, another family borrows it, etc. When it is the boy's mother's turn, Kojo uses a few of the coins to buy a hen. The story then follows him as he grows and slowly but steadily builds the proceeds from that one hen into the largest poultry farm in West Africa. Throughout, the author shows how his success impacts the lives of everyone it touches, from the people whom Kojo is able to employ to the taxes he pays that will build roads and medical facilities. The story is based on the experiences of an actual Ashanti poultry farmer and could open diverse avenues of discussion, including how a community's mutual support and teamwork operate for the good of all. Fernandes's large acrylic paintings capture the warmth of the climate and include numerous details, such as splashes of kente cloth, that authenticate the setting. There are also many illustrations that spark the imagination, such as the one of a tree with Kojo's first hen at its roots, growing more hens as the tree grows, with eggs blossoming from the branches. \r\nSchool Library Journal",

Rhondy tries hard to cheer her up by putting on a show, asking a neighbor to give her a call, and bringing her a pebble from the yard. At the last gift, Grandmama breaks down and cries, explaining to Rhondy that the two of them will have to leave their yard and house since Grandmama can no longer afford the rent. Rhondy cheers her grandmother by reminding her of the most important thing-they are other's joy. Thus the story achieves an emotionally satisfying ending without offering a false solution to the family's economic problem.",

When it is mentioned in his presence, he demands to see the evidence, saying, \"Where is it at?\" His disbelief is so great that he recruits his friend Tony Polito to accompany him on a search for spring. They wander the neighborhood, smelling the smells and going far beyond their usual turf. \r\nEventually, they see an abandoned car in a vacant lot and a strange noise is coming from it. As they conquer their fear and walk towards the car, they encounter some bright yellow flowers growing among the rubbish. When they reach the car, they discover a bird's nest containing a clutch of blue eggs, which prompts King to say, \"Man it's spring.\" Fortunately, Tony's big brother spots them and escorts them back to familiar territory.\r\nreview from amazon.com",

Naughty as can be, Tamika tests the limits of her grandfather's patience, but still that face does not appear. When he finds out why Tamika has misbehaved, her grandfather explains that the face she saw was just a pretend face.

Each of Greenfield's poems deals with everyday concerns and delights of African-American city children: a lonely boy gazes at the moon, waiting for his \"best, best friend\" to come home; a newborn baby swaddled in pink cries because she's \"too tiny a girl/ for this big new world.\" Nerissa tries to cheer her unemployed father and ill mother \"by telling them the best old/ bedtime jokes.\" The most powerful poem is \"The Seller,\" who \"comes around/ carrying in his many pockets/packages of death.\" The final poem depicts a young mother playing a trumpet on a porch late at night. She \"blows lullaby sounds/ into the silence/ the children hear and smile/ their sleep deepens/ and they are at peace/ with the night.\"",

The people are arranged by profession-literature, science and medicine, military, sports, entertainment, business, history, law and government, etc.-and the time period spans from the beginning of this country to the present. The authors provide concise, important background information on each subject, some of which is personal. For instance, when writing about Lt. Commander Wesley Brown, the first black man to enter the Naval Academy, the authors not only give standard biographical data but also mention the harassment and persecution he suffered. Because of the brevity of the entries-most are between one-third to one-half of a page-this volume is not an in-depth reference tool, but it is an excellent source for browsing and for locating facts that are hard to find elsewhere.

Beginning with the early days of segregation and ending with civil rights today, readers discover not only the work and speeches of the notable leaders, but also how children participated in the struggle. A balanced discussion notes tactical differences between the different groups and their actions. The text is tightly written with a strong voice that rings out in its recounting of past injustices. The ultimate message is that while the movement witnessed extraordinary accomplishments in the past 50 years, new challenges await young people of the new century; knowledge of the past is the foundation of future action. Activities include reenacting a lunch-counter sit-in, organizing a workshop on nonviolence, and holding a freedom film festival.",

  "description": "In unsentimental language, dwelling little on the details of street life, Guthrie presents a primary-school heroine with conscience and drive. Abby watches from her window after school and sees a ragged old lady digging in the trash cans in their multi-ethnic, multi-racial neighborhood. Thinking for the first time about hunger and homelessness, she enlists the help of her minister father, the local grocer, the owner of a restaurant supply store, and some retired neighbors to prepare a free meal for the local street people. Guthrie introduces the concept of homelessness without passing judgment, making this an enjoyable story as well as a social statement. Hockerman portrays Abby and her father (no mother is mentioned or appears) as a warm and loving family in full-color, bordered full-page, realistic drawings. The street people are honestly drawn as wellweary, bedraggled, and lined. Although A Rose for Abby opens doors for thought and discussion, it wisely attempts no solution.\nFrom School Library Journal",

The text consists of the baby's parents' simple declarations of reassurance, love, and inspiration. Ransome's realistic illustrations, rendered in oil, depict the African-American youngster's growth from his birth to his first day of school. Sometimes the illustrations cover a full page opposite a single short line of text; others cover a spread. The artwork always reflects the family's joy and love.

Though the trees towered over her, she had loved them for as long as she could remember. So strong, so beautiful, how the trees made her smile.\n\nWangari planted trees one by one to refresh her spirit. When the women came to her for help with their families, she told them to do the same. Soon the countryside was filled with trees. Kenya was strong once more. Wangari had changed her country, tree by tree.\n\nDonna Jo Napoli tells a story inspired by the life of 2004 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Wangari Maathai that will touch the hearts and spirits of all who read it.

A doughnut and coffee, with cream on the side. \n\nCourageously defying the WHITES ONLY edict of the era, four young black men took a stand against the injustice of segregation in America by sitting down at the lunch counter of a Woolworth's department store. Countless others of all races soon joined the cause following Martin Luther King Jr.'s powerful words of peaceful protest. By sitting down together, they stood up for civil rights and created the perfect recipe for integration not only at the Woolworth's counter, but on buses and and in communities throughout the South. \n\nPoetic storytelling and exuberant illustrations combine to celebrate a defining moment in the struggle for racial equality.

Shouting ?It?s my constitutional right!? as police dragged her off to jail, Claudette Colvin decided she?d had enough of the Jim Crow segregation laws that had angered and puzzled her since she was a young child.\n\nBut instead of being celebrated, as Rosa Parks would be when she took the same stand nine months later, Claudette found herself shunned by many of her classmates and dismissed as an unfit role model by the black leaders of Montgomery. Undaunted, she put her life in danger a year later when she dared to challenge segregation yet again ? as one of four plaintiffs in the landmark busing case Browder v. Gayle.\n\nBased on extensive interviews with Claudette Colvin and many others, Phillip Hoose presents the first in-depth account of a major, yet little-known, civil rights figure whose story provides a fresh perspective on the Montgomery bus protest of 1955?56. Historic figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks play important roles, but center stage belongs to the brave, bookish girl whose two acts of courage were to affect the course of American history.  -From BarnesandNoble.com",

On Warrior's back, he fights the stallion, defeats him, and then leads the animals into captivity in the ranch corral. Throughout, both text and pictures emphasize the blending of all life.

Unfortunately, when a new girl moves to their street, this friendship begins to unravel. Antonia isn't very friendly, so in retaliation, Nikki and Deja form an exclusive drill team club and vow to keep her out. When it comes to light that Nikki has no rhythm, the girls' insecurities come to a head, fueled by Antonia's manipulations. Eventually, Nikki and Deja realize how much they miss each other and make up. Nikki and Deja are still learning how to navigate complex relationships, alternating between codependence, jealousy, and stubbornness. And like most youngsters when faced with new emotional experiences, they don't always behave in the best manner possible.

  "description": "A boy searches for his newfound love among the city streets, to find that, unwarily, she's been caught in the arms of an evil street lord who means her harm. It is only through perseverance and undying love that the girl is returned to the safety of her one true love. Lyrical text and stunning mixed media artwork make for a powerful recasting of the classic ballet Swan Lake. \n\nThey danced like mist on water \n\nAs light as summer breeze. \n\nHe touched her waist; she kissed his cheek. \n\nHer eyes began to tease. \n\n\nSet among the asphalt of a housing project and the concrete of a basketball court, Walter Dean Myers' compelling work is delivered with rhythms that twist, hover, pounce, and inspire. For Amiri and Odette, love is hard when the streets are mean. Their dance for two becomes a fight for three, and their only chance is to hold fast to the power of being together as one. Part poem, part love story, part rap and rhapsody, AMIRI AND ODETTE: A DANCE FOR TWO celebrates hearts that beat forever. Accompanied by the collage-on-cinder-block paintings of Javaka Steptoe, this genre-breaking volume sets a new stage for a classic story. \nbarnesandnoble.com",

  "description": "Aesop's fable about the organized ant and the live-for-today grasshopper provides the picture-book story line, which is illustrated in highly colored and textured cartoon panels. The setting is urban contemporary, and the dialogue is heavily spiced with street talk and basketball references. The characters, Foxy G and Kid A, are depicted quickly and surely in both text and image as the story unfolds with its classic message. The final pages present a moral question usually ignored by Aesop's adaptors. Did the ant do the right thing by withholding charity from one who gave him aesthetic pleasure? The idea won't mean much to younger children, but it's exactly the right question to open discussion among older ones, who are becoming aware of the notion of strength of character.\r\nFrom Booklist",

  "description": "A child today learns from her grandmother how to make a sweet grass Gullah basket, a craft that her ancestors brought with them from West Africa to South Carolina and Georgia. The clear poetic words and exquisite watercolor illustrations depict how the small circular basket holds the big circle of African American history \"past slavery and freedom, old ways and new.\" Far across the ocean, the child's ancestor learned as a young boy to harvest tall grassy reeds and weave them into baskets to winnow the rice. When he came as a slave to a strange land and worked in the fields, he found similar grasses and continued to weave baskets in the old way, as did the woman he married. They passed on their craft and their stories, as the child's grandmother is doing now. Rooted in daily life, the metaphors grow naturally from the weaving action, with fingers that talk and show \"the road ahead was over and through.\" The small basket serves as a beautiful way to focus the sweep of African American history, and Lewis' astonishing pictures combine the panoramas of upheaval and war with portraits of individuals in small circles weaving and passing on their heritage in craft and story. The dramatic endpapers reinforce the strength of those ever-widening woven circles, their delicate beauty and enduring connections.\nFrom Booklist",

The night, reads the opening spread, across from an image of a mans face, his eyes shut; is beautiful, continues the next spread, showing the same face, now with eyes open and a wide smile. The text, sized big to balance the portraits, shows up in hues that range from white to tan to brown-black, reflecting Smiths reading that the words celebrate black people of differing shades and ages. An inventive design adds a short, shadowed row or column of small portraits to the edge of many spreads; these quietly reinforce the concept of my people. Whether of babies, children or adults, Smiths faces emerge into the light, displaying the best that humanity has to offer?intelligence, wisdom, curiosity, love and joy.\r\nFrom Publishers Weekly",

  "description": "On a parent-mandated cross-country road trip with Mere, their unpredictable grandmother, 15-year-old Octavia and 17-year-old Tali make the transformation from complaining, self-absorbed teens to observant, supportive family members. Mere promises not to smoke if the sisters promise not to use earphones on their way to a family reunion. And then she begins to tell her life story. As the miles pass from California across the southern states, the girls become intrigued with memories of Mere's harsh childhood of domestic work and her struggle to protect herself and younger sister from their widowed mother's lecherous boyfriend. Mere's account of her war years is full of historical detail and lively personal anecdotes about the training, treatment, duties, and social life in her African-American regiment of the Women's Army Corps both on assignment in the U.S. and in the European Theater during 1944 and 1945. Octavia and Tali write postcards home to family and friends revealing their adolescent reactions to what they see and hear. Their bickering subsides as they begin to understand the experiences, people, and decisions that shaped their grandmother and the family bond they all share. Told in alternating chapters of Then and Now, this contemporary intergenerational story resounds with mutual exasperation, criticism, discovery, and humor. Octavia and Tali are believable and at times devious as they try to escape Mere's scrutiny. A steady travelogue, realistic banter, memorable characters, and moments of tension, insight, and understanding make this an appealing selection.\r\nFrom School Library Journal",

But one year makes a big difference, and Tamika and her best friend are mean to Lily. They call her \"baby,\" but mostly they just ignore her. Even when Daddy teaches Lily to dive, they don't seem to care. In the end, Lily gives up, and she reluctantly accepts Keesha, also six, as a best friend. This is more situation than story, but the setting makes things special. The action takes place during the weekly playgroup at the neighborhood pool, and Lewis' beautiful, realistic double-page watercolors convey everything--the longing, the meanness, and the fun--through the body language and the splashing action of little girls in sunlit water and at the poolside. \r\nFrom Booklist",

  "description": "Myers revisits the theme of flight he explored in his mythically inspired Wings, this time with a more earthbound lesson in friendship. As a lone boy sits high atop his apartment building, he observes \"a twisting river of birds flying patterns above my house.\" An emerald-green background emphasizes the boy's downcast expression; the darkness seems to weigh upon him, despite his sunny yellow shirt. The artist then shifts the perspective from the exterior view of the window to the shadowy interior of the apartment the flying pigeons outside the window dominate the vignettes. As the boy voices his frustration at being trapped inside, he yells at the pigeons, until a voice comes from the rooftop \"like grits and gravy rains through the window.\" The voice belongs to the birds' keeper, an older man dressed in white \"his skin is dark brown, the color of church wood, and sharp at the edges.\" He becomes the boy's unlikely instructor in the ways of friendship. As the boy ascends the stairs to the roof, his very clothing reflects the inevitable transition he undergoes: his magenta pants blend with the stairwell, while the patch of sunlight at the summit matches his T-shirt. With the man's guidance, the inscrutable patterns of the birds make sense to the boy. Just as readers learn most effectively from Myers's nonverbal cues here, the boy, too, learns to bond with the man in white, and with his birds, through observation rather than words. \nFrom Publishers Weekly",

Frightening Boo Hags tell lies and are rude, and try to get children to disobey their mamas. Worst of all, they change shapes, so they are hard to recognize. Temptation comes in many forms and Precious is surely baited. But she is a plucky girl who confronts her fears and, in the end, clings to what she knows is right. The spirited language and vivid images will draw out the performer in every reader. The authors have produced an enchanting tale that is a pinch scary but a peck of fun. \nFrom School Library Journal",

  "description": "Evans's wonderful illustrations raise this paean to parental love a notch above the ordinary. \"My mama calls me girlpie. Her Sweet sweet. Daddy's honey bun chocolate Dew Drop. Homemade Love,\" says the small African-American narrator. The story line is minimal: her parents love her, even when she does something wrong, and their love supports her, even at night. The rhythm of the words, the smoothness of the text, and the positive message all combine to make a lovely read-aloud, despite a slightly treacly premise. Evans's folksy paintings, done in bright primary colors, are wonderful, with an appealing, dark-skinned, large-eyed little girl wearing dresses decorated with patterns that reflect the story. The artist fills up the pages so completely that readers only see the parents from the waist down for the first half of the book. When the child breaks something, her sorrow is evident, and after everything is all better, \"kiss kiss,\" she goes outside and does cartwheels in the flowers, exuding happiness and a zest for life. An appealing addition for most collections.\r\nFrom School Library Journal",

  "description": "The young African American narrator of this picture book spends a gloomy day with the blues; on the other hand, his energetic, ballet-crazy sister has a case of the pinks. Frame explores the spectrum of feelings, represented by different colors, that a sensitive little boy observes in himself and in others who live in his urban neighborhood. Cues in the artwork that can help children understand the emotions may occasionally be lost in Christie's sometimes dizzyingly askew compositions, but the vibrant palette and expressive characters perfectly reinforce the premise. Frame's soulful text describes each emotion with a flair for the telling detail (the father has \"got the grays. . . . / The don't ask for a new skateboard till tomorrow grays\"). At times, the author's free-associating can be a bit puzzling (the \"straight shoelaces, coffee in the car grays\"), but representing emotions with colors is an excellent way to introduce kids to metaphor. This will be a versatile tool for creative-writing units, too. from Booklist",

Drawn to Yasmin's confidence and determination, young women in particular sought her opinion on topics such as body image, popularity, dating, sexuality, child-parent relationships, and social and academic pressures. Yasmin could easily speak to those issues. She struggled with many of the same concerns when she was younger. \n\nInspired by the common threads connecting each generation, Yasmin developed The Blueprint for My Girls to help young women discover who they are, develop a sense of self, and stay positive. In the book, Yasmin pairs her personal stories with 99 \"expressions\" designed to help readers deal with situations they may not feel comfortable discussing with friends and family. Each expression is accompanied by exercises to help readers progress on their journey. \n\nStaying real without being preachy, The Blueprint for My Girls will be a solution giver, a problem solver, and a friend in need for generations to come.",

Her childhood was marked by dire hardships: by seven she was an orphan and working full-time as a laundress; by 20 she was a widow and a mother, beginning to go bald from years of poor nutrition and hard labor. In her 30s, she experimented with natural ingredients and chemicals and created a formula to restore the health of both hair and scalp. Beginning with door-to-door demonstrations in \"colored\" women's kitchens, she built her business into the Mme. C.J.

Life isn't easy being a quiet, bright, \"colored\" eighth-grader growing up in the '30s in Noble, Alabama. The fact that Francie can be a little willful doesn't always help. Her train promises escape, the chance to travel to \"places of possibility.\" And anywhere seems better than Noble, with its \"pickaninny\" racism and back-breaking routine, where she slaves away with her mother cooking and cleaning for white folks in town (when she isn't studying hard at Booker T. Washington, her clapboard country school, that is). \r\nFrancie dreams of Chicago, where her father moved a year ago to work as a Pullman porter, promising to send for Francie, her little brother Prez, and their mama as soon as he could. But Daddy has yet to come through, and Noble begins to offer possibilities of its own, the most exciting being when Francie puts her reading smarts to use tutoring an unschooled 16-year-old from nearby New Carlton. When he gets framed for attacking a white foreman, though, the courageous Francie can't keep from trying to help, endangering herself and those she holds dear. \r\nAmazon.com Review",

In less than two pages, he captures the huge crowd's eager anticipation, briefly describes the controversy sparked by the Daughters of the American Revolution's refusal to allow Anderson to appear at Constitution Hall, and mentions the significance of the concert. He leaves readers at the moment when \"A profound hush settled over the crowd.? she closed her eyes, lifted her head, clasped her hands before her, and began to sing.\" The author then switches to a chronological account of Anderson's life from her childhood in Philadelphia through her acclaimed U.S. and European concert tours in the 1920s and 1930s. He then gives a fuller account of the famous outdoor concert, which he refers to as a milestone in both musical and civil rights history. Freedman acknowledges that the singer did not set out to be a political activist or a crusader for civil rights. Numerous archival photographs, thorough chapter notes, a selected bibliography of works for both adult and younger readers, and a selected discography of currently available Anderson CDs are included.

An explosive confrontation takes place when the black man, Tom Bee, greets the clerk, John Wallace, by his first name--an intimacy unheard of at the time. A group of witnesses heckles Wallace for what they perceive as his permissiveness, and in spite of his private promise to Bee to allow him to greet him this way, Wallace betrays Bee, shooting him in the leg.

  "description": "Onyefulu's new photo-essay draws on her rich West African heritage to celebrate a strong cultural tradition. Told from the viewpoint of Amarlai, a Ga boy in Ghana, the handsome full-color photos and clear narrative show the particulars of a newborn and her extended family as small notes discuss the meaning of the community celebration. Amarlai's uncle explains that names tell a lot about people, including where they come from, what their tribe or clan is, the day of the week they were born, and their birth order. The photos picture people in traditional dress and in jeans, cooking and preparing for the party, and bringing gifts of money, food, and beautiful clothes. A joyful view of people today in touch with their roots. From Booklist",

  "description": "Far from the reverential, there is a lively mix of the traditional and the contemporary in this photo-essay about a wedding in Benin, Nigeria. Osaere is a doctor; Efosa is an architect. As Onyefulu points out in her introduction, the wedding is a family affair, and the close-up, full-color photos show the formal visits, when the relatives bring all kinds of gifts, including jewelry and foods (kola nuts stand for peace and harmony; schnapps is for the ancestors). After the formality, there is lots of teasing to cement the friendship. Then an old man talks to the ancestors, and Osaere and Efosa are married in traditional robes. Much later, there's a church wedding (he's in a tux; she wears a wedding gown), with even more guests, foods, and gifts. A young boy narrates the story, and kids will enjoy learning about the Nigerian ritual while they recognize the universal excitement of wedding pageantry and bonding. from Booklist",

Wilson-Max's big, clear pictures in his signature style, with thick black lines and bright colors, show an African American boy fuming and fussing until Daddy brings him comfort food and a book they can read together.

  "description": "Max begins explaining adaptation using his own backyard as the setting. He sees how animals have had to adapt in order to survive. Then the reader is taken back in time to learn about adaptation throughout the ages, including why the great dinosaurs eventually died out. From there he discusses physical adaptation. Believe it or not, I learned that the fennec fox relies on its fur to survive cold nights on the desert. Who would have thought of animals needing fur to live in a desert? Foxes living in the arctic have had to adapt over time to survive living in the frigid weather. Do you think that that might be why they have hair on the bottom of their paws or why they have small ears? Why would small ears keep you warm? Do you know why some plant leaves are waxy and that if they were not the plant would die? And then the behavioral adaptations are explained. The reader will learn that the hognose snake plays dead when in trouble and throws himself on his back and wiggles in pain then opens his mouth and sticks his tongue out. Hmm, do you know why he would do such a thing? When you read a science book with Max Axiom as your tour guide, it is like going on a adventure with your best friend. \nChildren's Literature Comprehensive Database",

  "description": "Max Axiom is a super cool science teacher who explains and demonstrates science so that others can learn about electricity. This engaging action-packed nonfiction presented in graphic narrative format resembles a cartoon. The voice bubbles of Max Axiom relate factual information told by Max as he travels from place to place, making observations about electricity and its impact on daily life. The text in this fascinating book contains short, direct sentences, and the vocabulary is controlled yet precise. There are four separate sections or chapters containing important information, such as how energy is converted to electricity and how power is at our fingertips. At the back of the book are an index, a glossary, a listing of suggested Internet sites, and a brief bio about the superhero of the book, Max Axiom. Rich with detailed accurate information and presented in a reader-friendly way, children who like superheroes and science, will enjoy reading this cartoonlike book over and over again to learn all about electricity.

  "description": "What a great idea! Taking a scientific concept, mixing it with a super hero who can shrink to the size of an atom, adding fantastic graphics, writing that is easy to understand, and then putting it together in a 32-page book that is reader friendly. This book is written in graphic format that is a favorite of mine! It makes it perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on will also enjoy the graphics and fast paced text. The full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. Red boxes with pertinent vocabulary words and meanings are included throughout the book. Vocabulary has been well selected and this book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or a source for research. Where do you sit on in a roller coaster to feel the best speed? If you said the first seat you would be wrong. To get the fastest ride, you need to sit in the last seat. Do know the fastest animal on earth? This animal can reach 200 mph. And I m not giving you the answer. You ll have to read the book to find out. Wow, these are just a few interesting facts found in the More About Forces and Motion section at the end of the book. Also included by the author are a Glossary, Read More Section, Internet sites, and an Index. This book should be in all science classrooms, school libraries, and added to reference books at home. I do highly recommend this book. Children's Literature Comprehensive Database",

  "description": "Did you know that without decomposers and scavengers, the world would be full of the remains of dead plants and animals? As nature s recyclers, decomposers are a necessary part of a ecosystem. I just love reviewing books from the Graphic Library series, because I learn so much. I don t know if I have forgotten over time or if I never learned complex science theories, but these books are super, presenting them in an interesting and understandable way! Max Axiom takes the reader on a journey explaining the how the ecosystems work. He uses powers that he acquired in a freak accident to make himself as small as an atom, and he wears a lab coat that allows him to travel through time. Throughout the book, the author includes boxes with further information and explanations of the topics being discussed. This is particularly useful in helping the reader understand the topics. At the end of the book, the reader will find more facts on the ecosystem, a list of books on the same topic, and Internet sites. Vocabulary has been well-chosen, and the full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. Children's Literature Comprehensive Database",

His biggest problem, though, turns out to be filling out the cover: name, grade, birth date, and race. Tiger is Black, Native American, and Hispanic. His teacher and a parent volunteer argue over the question, and finally tell him to fill in \"Other.\" He leaves the space blank, then worries that he will get in trouble for that. Later, Tiger's dad compares race to ice-cream flavors; no matter how many you mix together, you still have ice cream. Tiger feels better, and, fortunately, his teacher discovers that they were using an old test form. The new one has a \"Multiracial\" category. This quick, easy read touches on the issue of test anxiety, but is more about racial identity and pride. Tiger's voice accurately depicts a little boy who is anxious about something that everyone says is very important.\nFrom School Library Journal",

When she's not reading under the willow trees and drinking lemonade all day, she's fishing with her friends, investigating the mysterious disappearance of an entire family, or making a mule fly as a way of comforting an elderly friend in the hospital! When her best friends, Billy and Lump, go off to summer camp, Charlie manages to keep up a hilarious and informative correspondence with the two, even as she develops a new friendship with a girl who loves to garden. But the biggest surprise of all is when Charlie and her nemesis--her brother Sid--begin to get along when a neighbor needs their help.\nSequel to Maniac Monkeys on Magnolia Street, this collection of linked stories about the summertime adventures of a lively but easy-going trio is sheer delight for the independent chapter book reader.\nAmazon.com Review",

It's the summer after Black Panther founder Huey Newton was jailed and member Bobby Hutton was gunned down trying to surrender to the Oakland police, and there are men in berets shouting \"Black Power\" on the news. Delphine, 11, remembers her mother, but after years of separation she's more apt to believe what her grandmother has said about her, that Cecile is a selfish, crazy woman who sleeps on the street. At least Cecile lives in a real house, but she reacts to her daughters' arrival without warmth or even curiosity. Instead, she sends the girls to eat breakfast at a center run by the Black Panther Party and tells them to stay out as long as they can so that she can work on her poetry. Over the course of the next four weeks, Delphine and her younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern, spend a lot of time learning about revolution and staying out of their mother's way.\r\n\r\nFrom School Library Journal",

This audacious and intricately coordinated escape, masterminded by a 24-year-old sailor named Robert Smalls, astonished the world and exploded the Confederate claim that Southern slaves did not crave freedom or have the ability to take decisive action.",

  "description": "The conquest of the North Pole was an elusive, almost impossible goal at the beginning of the last century. But a son of patrician parents, Robert E. Peary, and a son of sharecroppers, Matthew Henson, shared a dream of conquering the unconquered North Pole and were brave enough to risk their lives numerous times before they finally succeeded. Henson?s great physical stamina and his ability to speak Inuit and develop warm relationships with the peoples of the Arctic were indispensable to the quest. He mastered the complexities of the dog sled and led the team across the layers of ice that covered the frigid, threatening Arctic Ocean. Henson and Peary?s jubilation at finally reaching the Pole was later dashed when controversy swirled around their achievement. Even after their deed was recognized, African American Henson?s contribution was largely overlooked. It took the world many years to hail him as a hero of exploration.",

Enduring every hardship from loneliness to attack by armed rebels to contact with killer lions and crocodiles, Salva is a survivor, and his story goes on to intersect with Nya?s in an astonishing and moving way.",

But beyond athletic skill, it was his strength of character that secured his place in sports history. In 1947 Jackie joined the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking the long-time color barrier in major league baseball. It was tough being first- not only did \"fans\" send hate mail but some of his own teammates refused to accept him. Here is an inspiring sports biography, with black-and-white illustrations throughout.",

Ever since a deeply unfortunate incident earlier this year, Reggie's been known as McKnight at his high-intensity Brooklyn middle school. He wants to turn his image around, but he has other things on his mind as well: his father, who's out of a job; his best friends, Ruthie and Joe C.; his former best friend Donovan, who's now become a jerk; and of course, the beautiful Mialonie. The elections for school president are coming up, but with his notorious nickname and  social status, Reggie wouldn't stand a chance, if he even had the courage to run.  Then Reggie gets involved with a local homeless shelter, the Olive Branch. Haunted by two of the clients there--George, a once-proud man now living on the streets, and Charlie, a six-year-old kid who becomes his official Little Buddy--he begins to think about making a difference, both in the world and at school. Pukey for President? It can happen . . . if he starts believing.",

They were both involved in two unrelated incidents with the same person, the resident menace at Alain Locke Middle, Tariq Molten.\r\n\r\nRobeson Battlefield is from a two parent household, where both parents are highly successful and educated. Academic achievement, social consciousness and responsibility are reinforced daily in the Battlefield household.\r\n\r\nPacino Clapton comes from a single parent household; his mom works two fulltime jobs. Pacino has a ton of responsibilities, including cutting hair to help pay bills, and taking care of his twin five- year-old sisters.\r\n\r\n During this three day span, the young men visit each others home, and \"chop it up\" on a multitude of subjects including respect of self and Black women, the dire state of hip-hop music, the use of the dreaded \"N\" word, and masculinity.\r\n\r\nBefore long, the three boys are on a collision course. And when they do intersect, their lives are changed forever.\r\n\r\nWe Could Brothers addresses the presence and lack of positive male leadership in the home, and how it dictates the way young African American men view themselves, each other, and the world around them. Mentorship, brotherhood, and an emphasis on that old adage \"each-one-teach-one\" are very real and tangible themes in this new YA literary masterpiece.",

He's just about to enter high school, and his biggest worries are his new bottom-of-the-totem-pole status as an incoming freshman and his father's constant lectures about becoming a man. Growing further apart from his younger siblings -- precocious eight-year-old twins -- Jordan thinks his only ally is his grandmother, a hip sixty-two-year-old with a youthful glow that comforts Jordan, especially in the absence of his mother.\r\n\r\nBut when his widowed father suddenly dies, Jordan finds the journey through puberty to adulthood all the more daunting. He feels alone despite the best efforts of his family and friends. He is resentful and confused about new responsibilities forced on him, and torn between acting with his heart or fulfilling the expectations of those around him. A mysterious neighborhood shopkeeper, Snackman, notices Jordan's dilemma and steps in as surely as Jordan's own father would have. He offers Jordan a dirty strip of kente cloth, which he says contains the answers to Jordan's problems. And through this strip of cloth, Snackman guides Jordan to the answer of what it is to be a Black man. But not before Jordan meets with an almost disastrous fire and realizes his true importance to his family.",

She married another slave and had five children, one of whom was sold when he was five years old. Because her home state of New York had outlawed slavery in 1817, Isabella knew this sale was illegal. She went to court and won her son back. This was the first victory of a Black woman over a White man in court. After this, Isabella changed her name to Sojourner Truth and became a crusader against slavery. She advocated equal rights and fair laws for all.",

The author goes on to tell the story of the nine students who endured a distressful year at Central (protected by soldiers sent by President Eisenhower), and a further year of closed schools ordered by Orville Faubus, Governor of Arkansas. Studying hard and remaining engaged, the students did eventually graduate, though not all from Central High; they later won numerous awards for their dignity and courage.",

  "description": "As a young slave, Frederick Douglas was fortunate (in one sense) that one of his owners taught him to read. And he, in turn, taught other slaves to read. Frederick yearned to be a free man although his first attempt ended in failure. The desire to be free never left him. Eventually he did manage to escape, marry, start a family, and in time settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts. At an abolitionist meeting he met and became friends with William Lloyd Garrison. He joined with him in the fight against slavery by publishing an antislavery newspaper and giving public speeches about slavery.",

Instead, Mary McLeod taught at Emma Wilson's school, at the Haines Institute, and later at the Kendall Institute. In Florida, she ran the Daytona Institute which was later renamed the Bethune-Cookman College. Mary McLeod Bethune strongly felt that the students should \"think with their heads?do with their hands?serve and teach others from their hearts\" so her motto was of \"heads, hands, and heart.\" Because of Bethune's work, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed her to a position in the National Youth Administration which helped young adults with job training.",

In 1843 God came to Isabella in a vision telling her to speak out against the wrongs in this country. Changing her name to Sojourner Truth, she walked west, speaking in towns along the way against slavery and in support of women's rights. Sojourner was a dedicated worker and powerful force until her death in 1883.",

Both of them yearn to move up north, where Carissa was born.\n\nInto their lives rides an elderly man on a shiny blue bicycle.\nBailey is a wanderer, a storyteller, a thinker, a kind and sociable man who can repair and tighten up and fix just about anything.\nSoon he?s part of Carissa?s life, almost like the grandfather she never had. He teaches her how to ride his bicycle, and how to find her balance in other ways as well, and Bailey?s time with Carissa and her mother helps him decide how to continue his own journey.",

  "description": "Patrice Williams was happy living in Georgia with her grandmother, who called her ?cocoa grandbaby.? Then her mother lured her to Chicago and ended up in jail. Now Patrice lives with her Auntie Mae, and her new nickname is ?Puffy? ? thanks to her giant poof of hair. But Patrice?s hair isn?t the only reason she sticks out: she cares about her grades and strives for the best. That?s why Monty Freeman, another eighth grader who lives in the building, asks Patrice to tutor his little brother. Even though Monty?s friends make Patrice uneasy, Monty himself is friendly, confident, and surprisingly smart. When he becomes her guardian angel, Patrice begins to think something stronger than friendship might be growing between them. Still, nothing will stop her from applying for a scholarship at prestigious Dogwood Academy ? her ticket out of the project and a school populated by gangs and drug runners.",

His foster mother, Miss Edna, is growing on him. She's already raised two sons and she seems to know what makes them tick. And his teacher, Ms. Marcus, is showing him ways to put his jumbled feelings on paper.",

His white father has acknowledged him and raised him openly-something unusual in post-Civil War Georgia. But as he grows into a man he learns that life for someone like him is not easy. Black people distrust him because he looks white. White people discriminate against him when they learn of his black heritage. Even within his own family he faces betrayal and degradation. So at the age of fourteen, he sets out toward the only dream he has ever had: to find land every bit as good as his father's, and make it his own.",

She will do just about anything legal to get her hands on the almighty dollar--wash cars, sell rotten candy, skip lunch, clean houses. She is obsessed. She is driven. She is afraid. Memories of being homeless, sleeping in the streets, and eating handouts keep Raspberry's eye on the only prize that matters to her: cold, hard cash. When the green stuff greases her palm, she gets comfort from feeling its crinkly paper power. And, when money is your best friend, there's more to do than hold it. Raspberry kisses her cash. She smells it. She loves it. \nBut even money can't answer the questions that keep Raspberry awake at night. Will she and Momma ever move out of the projects? What did Ja'nae do with the two hundred bucks Raspberry loaned her? And what's really going on with Momma and that rich doctor?",

Over time, the bones became the subject of stories and speculation in Waterbury. In 1996 a group of community-based volunteers, working in collaboration with the museum staff, discovered that the bones were those of a slave named Fortune who had been owned by a local doctor. After Fortune's death, the doctor dissected the body, rendered the bones, and assembled the skeleton. A great deal is still not known about Fortune, but it is known that he was baptized, was married, and had four children. He died at about the age of 60, sometime after 1797.Marilyn Nelson was commissioned by the Mattatuck Museum and received a grant from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts to write a poem in commemoration of Fortune's life.",

On the first day of the auction, the skies darkened and torrential rain began falling. The rain continued throughout the two days, stopping only when the auction had ended. The simultaneity of the rain storm with the auction led to these two days being called \"the weeping time.\" Master storyteller Julius Lester has taken this footnote of history and created the crowning achievement of his literary career. \nJulius Lester tells the story of several characters including Emma, a slave owned by Pierce Butler and caretaker of his two daughters, and Pierce, a man with a mounting gambling debt and household to protect. Emma wants to teach his daughters?one who opposes slavery and one who supports it?to have kind hearts. Meanwhile, in a desperate bid to survive, Pierce decides to cash in his ?assets? and host the largest slave auction in American history. And on that day, the skies open up and weep endlessly on the proceedings below.",

Orgill recounts how Fitzgerald earned nickels dancing the Lindy Hop on the streets of Yonkers before moving to Harlem, where she would begin her tremendous career, trusting in her talent and persevering in spite of the bandleaders who thought she wasn't pretty enough. Occasional lyrics pop on the page and suggest that this might make a good read-aloud, but the fairly lengthy text will require dedicated attention. -from Booklist",

  "description": "They were each born with the gift of gospel.  Martin's voice kept people in their seats, but also sent their praises soaring. Mahalia's voice was brass-and-butter - strong and smooth at the same time.  With Martin's sermons and Mahalia's songs, folks were free to shout, to sing their joy.  On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and his strong voice and powerful message were joined and lifted in song by world-renowned gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. It was a moment that changed the course of history and is imprinted in minds forever. Told through Andrea Davis Pinkney's poetic prose and Brian Pinkney's evocative illustration, the stories of these two powerful voices and lives are told side-by-side -- as they would one day walk -- following the journey from their youth to a culmination at this historical event when they united as one and inspiring kids to find their own voices and speak up for what is right.",

  "description": "A celebration of Pullman porters is the focus of this new picture-book edition of Langston Hughes? classic poem. The collage spreads, blending oil paintings and cut paper, begin with an image of a speeding train before moving on to large portraits of African American porters serving white passengers aboard a luxury train. When the passengers leave, the porters gather left-behind items?newspapers, blues and jazz albums?and toss them from the train. Carried by the wind, the words and music fall into the hands of African Americans across the country. The final, contemporary pages show young black people celebrating their place in America and dreaming of a bright future. Collier?s long final note explains his interpretation of the poem, and with adult help, kids can look closely at what the pictures show about the porters then and now as well as Collier?s visual themes, including the recurring use of stars and stripes, which culminate in a beautiful, final close-up of a boy with his mother staring through a train window today at the starry city sky. - Booklist",

Even so, his mother begged the church fathers to allow him into the priesthood. Instead, Martin was accepted as a servant boy. But soon, the young man was performing miracles. Rumors began to fly around the city of a strange mulatto boy with healing hands, who gave first to the people of the barrios. Martin continued to serve in the church, until he was finally received by the Dominican Order, no longer called the worthless son of a slave, but rather a saint and the rose in the desert.",

He loved looking at something in the room and making it come alive again in front of him. He drew pictures for his sisters, his classmates, his co-workers. Even during W.W.I, Horace filled his notebooks with drawings from the trenches . . . until he was shot. Upon his return home, Horace couldn't lift his right arm, and couldn't make any art. Slowly, with lots of practice, he regained use of his arm, until once again, he was able to paint--and paint, and paint! Soon, people?including the famous painter N. C. Wyeth?started noticing Horace's art, and before long, his paintings were displayed in galleries and museums across the country.",

In Johannesburg, the country's capital, Mandela saw fellow Africans who were poor and powerless. He decided then that he would work to protect them. When the government began to keep people apart based on the color of their skin, Mandela spoke out against the law and vowed to fight hard in order to make his country a place that belonged to all South Africans.  Kadir Nelson tells the story of Mandela, a global icon, in poignant verse and glorious illustrations. It is the story of a young boy's determination to change South Africa and of the struggles of a man who eventually became the president of his country by believing in equality for people of all colors. Readers will be inspired by Mandela's triumph and his lifelong quest to create a more just world.",

During World War II, African American soldiers were mostly relegated to service and security jobs, generally denied the same training and active-combat positions that were available to their white counterparts. Expertly woven together are two narratives: the large, overarching history of rampant racism in the U.S. military and the smaller, tightly focused account of a group of black soldiers determined to serve their country and demonstrate their value as soldiers. Readers are taken along on the emotional journey with the soldiers as they leapt forward from guard duty at The Parachute School into official paratrooper training, the first of its kind for blacks. They faced multiple setbacks as they encountered discrimination, some justified as \"policy\" and some that was more personal and insidious. Throughout the book, the courage and strength of these men is evidenced in their tireless quest to be the best at what they do, throwing themselves headlong into sometimes dangerous and terrifying training requirements.",

Omar \"T-Diddy\" Smalls has the swagger that comes with his exalted status. The fact that he has moved to Charleston, S.C., from Brooklyn adds to his aura, and he attracts the attention of every desirable girl at school--except for Claudia Clarke, who calls him \"immature, shallow [and a] fraud.\" Omar never runs away from a challenge, and he bets his friends that Claudia will become his next conquest. Socially conscious, Claudia is more interested in protesting budget cuts that will wipe out the arts, the library and other school activities--excluding sports--than in Omar. Omar uses his considerable charisma and stories from his activist uncle to lead a successful protest and bring the impending cuts much-needed attention. Through working together, Omar develops genuine feelings for Claudia, and she finds herself drawn to him. Told in alternating chapters by each of the main characters, this lively romance has humor and heart. The use of social media anchors the story in today's culture, while the banter between Omar and Claudia is clever and sounds just right for two smart, college-bound teens. Urban-fiction readers will enjoy this, but it will also appeal to any teen reader seeking a romantic read with lots of fun. - Kirkus Review",

Maxie knows all about how fire can erupt at a moment?s notice, especially now, in the sweltering Chicago summer of 1968. She is a Black Panther?or at least she wants to be one. Maxie believes in the movement. She wants to belong. She wants to join the struggle. But everyone keeps telling her she?s too young. At fourteen, she?s allowed to help out in the office, but she certainly can?t help patrol the streets. Then Maxie realizes that there is a traitor in their midst, and if she can figure out who it is, it may be her ticket to becoming a real Panther. But when she learns the truth, the knowledge threatens to destroy her world. Maxie must decide: Is becoming a Panther worth paying the ultimate price?",

  "description": "With great affection, a Brooklyn girl tells the story of her grandmother, mother and a rope that forms a bond across three generations. When just a little girl in South Carolina, the grandmother finds a rope under a tree and uses it to play jump-rope. The rope becomes entwined in the family story as the grandparents, with a baby in their arms, move to Brooklyn, and that baby grows up to become mother to the narrator. Whether used for games, for tying down luggage on a car or for holding high a banner at a grand family reunion, the rope is treasured. -Kirkus Review",

  "description": "A Band of Angels is fiction, but it is based on real events and people. The character of Ella was inspired by Ella Sheppard Moore, who was born February 4, 1851, in Nashville, Tennessee. Her father was able to free himself and young Ella from slavery, but before he could buy freedom for Ella's mother she was sold away. Ella was raised in Cincinnati, where she took music lessons. At fifteen, she was left penniless when her father died. She arrived at Fisk School in 1868 with only six dollars.  Fisk was opened in 1866 as a school for former slaves and began offering college classes in 1871. That year, in a desperate attempt to save Fisk from closing, a music teacher named George White set out with a group of students on a singing tour to raise money. Although at first they only sang popular music of the day, they soon became famous for introducing spirituals to the world.  Ella Sheppard was the pianist for the Jubilee Singers on their historic concert tours, which raised enough money to save the school and build Jubilee Hall, the first permanent structure in the South for the education of black students. Ella later married George Moore, had three children, and located her mother and a sister. She died in 1914. Today her great-granddaughter is a librarian at Fisk University who shares the history of the Jubilee Singers with visitors.  Although none graduated from Fisk, the original Jubilee Singers were recognized with honorary degrees in 1978. Today, Jubilee Singers at Fisk University continue to keep alive a rich musical tradition that includes such songs as \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,\" \"Many Thousand Gone,\" and \"Go Down, Moses.\"  The daughter of a slave forms a gospel singing group and goes on tour to raise money to save Fisk University.",

One winter day in 1818, when many of the firefighting volunteers are sick with influenza and a small wooden house is ablaze, Molly jumps into action and helps stop the blaze, proudly earning the nickname Volunteer Number 11. Relying on historic records and pictures and working closely with firefighting experts, Dianne Ochiltree and artist Kathleen Kemly not only bring this spunky and little-known heroine to life but also show how fires were fought in early America.",

Text is kept to a minimum, with a few carefully chosen words to describe what is visually represented on each page. For example, one page of a spread reads, \"February 1, 1960.

In capturing Johnson?s battles in and out of the ring, the authors relay one of life?s most important messages: never give up on your dreams, no matter what barriers stand in your way.",

Using secondhand Fords that he fixed up in his garage, he competed in five hundred races in NASCAR?s top division.  Eric Velasquez?s illustrations and Carole Boston Weatherford?s rhythmic text illuminate the story of a man who worked full-time while racing on the side.

When she tries to speak for herself, no one listens. The breaking point comes when her friend invites her to a sleepover. Mother says that Daisy has never slept at someone's house, and her sister insists she will come home in the middle of the night. Daisy announces that she is going to Rosa's anyway, but no one hears. When the family finally goes in search of her, they discover a Daisy they never knew. The text is brief, extended by the details and facial expressions in the mixed-media, double-page illustrations. In the first spread, Cummings offers an arresting close-up of Daisy, her face split down the middle by the book's gutter, hair flying across both pages, hands up to her head in a gesture of hopelessness. Her family cavorts on either side. The contrast between that picture, on a blue background, and the last one, when \"for the first time, everybody listened [to Daisy],\" is marvelous.",

Thankfully, Sugar has a knack for finding her own fun, especially when she joins forces with forbidden friend Billy, the white plantation owner's son.  Sugar has always yearned to learn more about the world, and she sees her chance when Chinese workers are brought in to help harvest the cane. The older River Road folks feel threatened, but Sugar is fascinated. As she befriends young Beau and elder Master Liu, they introduce her to the traditions of their culture, and she, in turn, shares the ways of plantation life. Sugar soon realizes that she must be the one to bridge the cultural gap and bring the community together. Here is a story of unlikely friendships and how they can change our lives forever.  From Jewell Parker Rhodes, the author of Ninth Ward (a Coretta Scott King Honor Book and a Today show Al's Book Club for Kids pick), here's another tale of a strong, spirited young girl who rises beyond her circumstances and inspires others to work toward a brighter future.",

Moore, an investment banker, Rhodes scholar, and former aide to Condoleezza Rice, was intrigued when he learned that another Wes Moore, his age and from the same area of Greater Baltimore, was wanted for killing a cop. Meeting his double and delving into his life reveals deeper likenesses: raised in fatherless families and poor black neighborhoods, both felt the lure of the money and status to be gained from dealing drugs. That the author resisted the criminal underworld while the other Wes drifted into it is chalked up less to character than to the influence of relatives, mentors, and expectations that pushed against his own delinquent impulses, to the point of exiling him to military school. Moore writes with subtlety and insight about the plight of ghetto youth, viewing it from inside and out; he probes beneath the pathologies to reveal the pressures?poverty, a lack of prospects, the need to respond to violence with greater violence?that propelled the other Wes to his doom. The result is a moving exploration of roads not taken.",

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells?taken without her knowledge?became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first ?immortal? human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they?d weigh more than 50 million metric tons?as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb?s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.  Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta?s family did not learn of her ?immortality? until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family?past and present?is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.",

In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.  What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.  In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.   This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.",

And today Larry Doby and the Indians are playing Game Four of the World Series against the Boston Braves! With a play-by-play narration capturing all the excitement of that particular game - and the special thrill of listening to it on the radio with family at home - Chris Crowe and Mike Benny craft a compelling tribute to an unsung legend. Kid-friendly and vividly illustrated, this long-overdue biography, featuring an extensive bibliography and historical note, illuminates the effect Larry Doby had on his fans as both a baseball hero and a champion for civil rights.",

On Easter Sunday 1939, Marian Anderson performed at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial in front of a crowd of over 75,000 people. The person largely responsible for putting her there was a white man, Oscar Chapman, assistant secretary of the interior under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When Chapman learned that Marian Anderson was not allowed to sing at Constitution Hall because of the color of her skin, he took it upon himself to do the impossible: find Marian Anderson an appropriate venue for a concert and make an important statement about equality and the rights of all Americans. With support from the highest levels of U.S. government, Chapman helped produce a landmark concert that - for at least one evening - bridged the color divide to bring a city and much of the nation together.",

For her family and others like them, it was a time of renewed faith in America?s promise of ?freedom and justice for all.? Blessed with a strong will, an eager mind, and a deep belief in this promise, young Ida never turned away from the challenges she faced. She insisted on holding her family together after the death of her parents. She defied convention and went to court when a railroad company infringed on her rights. And she used her position as a journalist to speak out about injustice. But Ida?s greatest challenge arose after one of her friends was lynched. How could one headstrong young woman help free America from the ?shadow of lawlessness? that loomed over the country?",

In Greg and the Cheat Sheet, Greg McNair works hard at school, at home, and in the community. In fact, he?s earned the nickname Greg the Good for his helpful, honest behavior! School is starting and Greg has studied hard enough to skip a grade?now he?s in the same class as his cousin James. Greg knew jumping into sixth grade would be tough, but he didn?t think he?d be failing in the first week! James isn?t doing so well either. When James hears about a guy who sells cheat sheets, he sets out to find him and take the easy way to an A. Will Greg follow James?s lead and cheat? Or will he continue to make good choices and study to earn his grade?",

  "description": "In the last few decades, more and more people are going to college to further their education. It's hard to become a scientist, a professor, or a businessperson without getting some sort of college degree--but college isn't always necessary to achieve success. Some people are ready to enter the workforce right after high school. Tyra Banks was one of those people. The supermodel and fashion icon has become one of the biggest names in television, hosting her own talk show and the successful \"America's Next Top Model\". While many models have short careers based on their looks alone, Tyra has found success in entertainment and business well beyond the catwalk and magazine photo shoots. And what's most amazing about her story is that the stylish superstar has done it all without a college degree!",

It was but one of the many injustices Malcolm and his family, and other African Americans, suffered in the United States where segregation and discrimination were law. Life's lessons turned Malcolm Little into a controversial, defiant, and rebellious man named Malcolm X. He became the best known spokesperson for the Nation of Islam and one of the most influential leaders of the Civil Rights movement. His outspoken nature gained him many followers and just as many enemies. Malcolm X's life came to a violent end in 1965, but his fight for justice and equality will forever be remembered.",

Ali's passion to speak his mind and stand up for his beliefs stood as a hallmark throughout a boxing career that spanned more than twenty years. Decades after his boxing career ended, he continued to tour the world promoting peace and spreading goodwill even as his own health deteriorated. Over the years, he truly earned the nickname he first bestowed upon himself way back in 1964 when he first won the heavyweight crown: \"The Greatest.\"",

When Rosa Parks, exhausted after a long day at work, refused to give up her bus seat for a white man, she defied the strict segregation laws that made blacks second-class citizens. What followed was a test of courage and resolve that ultimately reshaped the nation. Using powerful illustrations and accessible text, this exciting graphic novel tells the story of actions, arrests, and the dramatic events that followed.",

  "description": "The story of a group of African American students known as the Little Rock Nine is a saga of incredible courage and grace. Following the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that struck down school segregation, black leaders turned their attention to the next challenge: getting African American students into white schools. In Little Rock, Arkansas, a small group of African American students were selected to integrate the high school. This taut, thrilling graphic novel plunges readers into the cauldron of hate, bigotry, and fear the students faced. Powerful illustrations grip readers, and accessible text presents the emotionally charged events in readily understandable language.",

Where is Early's father? He's not the kind of father who would disappear. But he's gone . . . and he's left a whole lot of trouble behind.  As danger closes in, Early, her mom, and her brother have to flee their apartment. With nowhere else to go, they are forced to move into a city shelter. Once there, Early starts asking questions and looking for answers. Because her father hasn't disappeared without a trace. There are patterns and rhythms to what's happened, and Early might be the only one who can use them to track him down and make her way out of a very tough place.

Born in the poor Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles, statistically, Will was more likely to join a gang than to become Will.i.am, the famous rapper and songwriter from the wildly popular Black Eyed Peas. Will might have had an idea of what lay ahead of him, though. At the age of 11, he promised his mother that he would buy her a house one day. Once he made it big, he did just that?and one for his grandmother as well. It is no wonder that the words i.am are the end of this amazing artist?s name. Today, Will is known for being many things to many people. In addition to performing with the Peas, he writes music for both his own group and for many other well?known artists, as well. He also acts in films, supports presidential candidates, and heads several charities. His story is truly one of inspiration.",

For Alicia, the school was an artistic playground. Soon, she was on her way to her first recording contract. After disagreements with Columbia Records, Alicia was able to record her music her own way, for Clive Davis and his newly formed J Records. Her debut album, Songs in A Minor, along with her hit single, \"Fallin,\" have put Alicia in the winner's circle with five Grammy Awards. Her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, became a triple platinum album.",

In order to prepare, Kim and her friends read all about South Africa, a rich and beautiful country at the southern tip of the African continent. The class learns about this country's sad history of racial segregation, as well as its amazing transition to the rainbow nation it is today. They read about South Africa's mineral wealth, and its plant and animal diversity. They are amazed to discover that South Africa has eleven different official languages, five of which are included in the national anthem. Kim and her classmates cook mielie pap, a traditional South African food, and make an African penguin craft to greet their new friend. Molo, Zaziwe!",

Singing came naturally to Bessie and as a young girl she helped support her family as a street singer in Chattanooga, Tennessee. When she was seventeen Bessie joined a traveling show and worked her way up to the black vaudeville circuit. Her popularity led to a recording contract that eventually established her as the most successful black performing artist of her time, earning as many fans in the North as she had in the South. But for as gifted as she was a singer, Bessie was also troubled and difficult off stage. Alcohol abuse led to violent outbursts that alienated many friends and associates. After a brief career slump Bessie was on tour making a comeback when tragedy struck and she was killed in a car accident. Although her life was cut short, her impact on music lives on to this day.",

As Billie Holiday, she overcame personal crises and racial bigotry to become what many consider to be America?s premier jazz vocalist of the twentieth century. Then, like a flamed?out meteor, she crashed and burned in the throes of alcohol and drug addiction.  Lady Day, as Billie was known to her friends and admirers, joined a handful of jazz musicians who can truly be called legendary. Her voice was one of a kind; her lyrical interpretations, intimate?and often sensually expressive or disturbingly bitter. She profoundly influenced her fellow musicians, not only in jazz, but in every other musical genre. Billie?s life and legacy are emblematic of both triumph and tragedy: She overcame more than her share of adversities, but she could not conquer her urge to self-destruct.  Denotes mature audience: May not be suitable for some elementary readers due to attitudes and lifestyles expressed by the celebrity.",

He began his unparalleled rise to greatness in the world of jazz in Kansas City, Missouri, in the mid?1930s. ?Bird,? as Parker was known first to his friends and later to the world, honed his early skills on a $45 used alto saxophone bought for him by his mother Addie Parker. The old horn was decrepit. Its valves were always sticking, its pads were always leaking, and it had rubber bands and cellophane paper all over it. Charlie had to hold it sideways to make it blow. But the sound he blew would later dazzle a world of admirers and imitators. Known for his direct, cutting tone and extraordinary dexterity on the alto saxophone, Parker turned rapid tempos and fast flurries of notes into a new kind of music known as bebop or bop. The Bird flew high for two decades, then plunged precipitously to an early death from drug- and alcohol-addiction at the age of 34?a legend then and so he remains today.",

  "description": "Ragtime was an immensely popular form of music in the United States prior to World War I. Its toe?tapping style was exactly what a country like America, bursting into the 20th century full of excitement and enthusiasm, desired. Ragtime was uniquely American?just as America was unique among all the nations in the world.  Scott Joplin was the King of Ragtime. His ragtime songs defined the genre and brought it into the homes of millions of people. Yet Joplin wanted more than that. He wanted to be known as a serious artist, a man whose work would elevate him along with the entire African?American community. His struggles in that regard make his life story all the more memorable.",

Prizes for writing soon followed, and in fifth grade her winning poem about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was so well done, everyone thought she copied it from a book. This notoriety taught Jacqueline that she could use writing to get people?s attention. As Jacqueline grew older, she began to notice poverty, discrimination, and inequality all around her and decided to do something about it. She would use books like I Hadn?t Meant to Tell You This, Lena, and If You Come Softly to let everyone know about people who were mistreated because they were different.",

This volume will detail the lives and careers of such sports legends as Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali, and Michael Jordan, and explore the impact of more recent sensations such as Venus and Serena Williams and Tiger Woods. Even those who are reluctant to pick up a book will have a hard time resisting the pull of the sports legends in this book.",

Initially a much sought-after producer of other artists' albums (Jay-Z, Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys, Mobb Deep, Cam'ron, John Legend), West had great difficulty getting a record contract for his own work. His father was a Black Panther-turned photojournalist and born again Christian counselor, and his mother was a university English professor. West was thought to lack the \"street cred\" necessary to be a serious and popular rapper. Yet once given his chance, West electrified the world of hip-hop, releasing two albums in two years, both of which went triple platinum. His third album won four Grammy Awards in 2008 and sampled songs by artists far outside the hip-hop universe, such as Steely Dan and Laura Nyro. Viewing his role as an educator, West claims to rap about historical subjects in a way that gets his young listeners interested in learning more. Yet he also courts controversy, such as his live, on-air criticism of President Bush during a Hurricane Katrina telethon and his criticism of rap lyrics' often homophobic bent. Outspoken, egotistical, unconventional, inventive, and ingenious, Kanye West is one of the hip-hop world's most fascinating and unpredictable artists.",

  "description": "Beginning to rap at the age of 9, Ludacris (born Christopher Brian Bridges) drew on a wide range of musical influences supplied by his father, who steeped his son in many genres of popular music. Soon he was recording boisterous and madcap rap albums, each of which went double or triple platinum. He has sold 13 million records and is tied for second in the category of solo rapper with the most Billboard Hot 100 Number One Hits. Not content to confine himself to music, Ludacris has also appeared in several high profile, popular, and critically successful films. Despite run-ins with media giants Oprah Winfrey and Bill O'Reilly over the content of his lyrics, Ludacris is generally regarded as a genial and light-hearted rap superstar, one whose range of talents are only beginning to be revealed to an increasingly enthusiastic public.",

  "description": "Penny wanted to wear her hair ?down? like all of the other girls in her class. She wondered why her friends had long straight hair and she did not. Feeling different made her feel sad. Penny?s mom assured her that her hair is perfect. Just because her hair is different from her friends hair, it didn't mean that it was bad. Penny's mom decides to style her hair in puffballs, magic puffballs. Penny learns though a series of fun adventures, that wonderful and magical things happen when she wears her puffballs. Join Penny as she discovers the magic of her puffballs. Message from the author: Penny was born out of my love for my daughter, Paris, and my desire for her to feel comfortable, confident and secure in her skin. Paris questioned why her hair was different from all of the other girls? and wondered why she couldn?t wear her hair like theirs. I wanted her to understand that her hair was different but that different didn?t mean bad. One night, I made up a bedtime story about a little girl named Penny who had magic puffballs in her hair. Both my daughter and my son loved it so much that they wanted to hear about Penny every night. To keep it interesting, each night I added a different adventure, and from time to time I introduced additional characters. The kids loved these stories so much that Penny became a staple in our bedtime routine. I ended up with more than 30 stories, and we enjoyed Penny?s adventures for many, many years. The idea for a book came to me as I saw little girls throughout my travels with their hair styled in puffballs. I thought it would be great to be able to tell these girls the story of Penny, a little girl like them. Little girls often notice their hair as one of the first areas of difference, and seeing this as bad can lead to a poor self-image. It is my hope that through this book, other girls will see a bit of themselves in Penny and enjoy her magic puffballs.",

  "description": "Before Tom Feelings passed away in August of 2003, he had been working on a picture book with his friend, poet Kwame Dawes. As Kwame explains, \"One day, Tom gave me a folder of drawings of young people from his journeys around the world. I saw a story of resilience and pride, and wrote my poem as a response.\" These wonderful drawings, paired with lyrical text, offer a fresh encounter with one of our most evocative illustrators.   This poem, written in response to those drawings, is a moving tribute to Feelings's creativity and artistry. The verses take readers on a global journey through young black faces seen in Africa, North and South America, Europe, and the Caribbean. The final lines of the poem read, \"I see your face look back at me/Full of ancient stories and dreams/That tell me we have traveled far/And survived the journeys well.\"",

Not when Kevon's acting like he's better than Jarrett -- and not when Jarrett finds out Kevon's keeping some major secrets.",

As far as he?s concerned, Christmas is the best?no school, presents, fun parties, and lots of cookies! But before EllRay can celebrate with his family, he must lead half the school in the Winter Wonderland assembly.  How tough can it be to memorize a few lines? Very tough, especially when EllRay?s soon-to-be ex-friend gives him a challenge to perform onstage. If he completes the challenge, he?ll save his friendship...but he?ll also ruin the assembly. EllRay is in for a not-so holly jolly time.   It?s almost Christmas and school is going great for EllRay. He?s ?blending in? just the way he likes. So when his father tells him he should be proud to be part of the African-American ?community,? EllRay isn?t so sure he wants to call attention to his differences. After all, he?s only one of two boys in his class with brown skin. And then, totally by accident, he insults the other boy?one of his best friends?and all at once EllRay?s back to being the center of attention. And not exactly for good reasons.   With Sally Warner?s trademark sense of humor and spot-on dialogue, EllRay confronts questions about race and how it impacts both himself and everyone around him.",

For example, Rosa Parks dared to stand up for herself and other African Americans by staying seated, and as a result she helped end public bus segregation and launch the country?s Civil Rights Movement.",

He teaches them how to restore the soil and respect the balance of nature. He even prepares a delicious lunch made of plants, including \"chicken\" made from peanuts. And Sally never forgets the lessons this wise man leaves in her heart and mind. Susan Grigsby's warm story shines new light on an African American scientist who was ahead of his time.",

A 14-year-old black boy from Chicago visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955, Till was taken from his uncle?s home by two white men; several days later, his body was found in the Tallahatchie River. This grotesque crime became the catalyst for the civil rights movement.  At age 12, author Simeon Wright saw and heard his cousin Emmett whistle at a white woman at a grocery store; he was sleeping in the same bed with him when Emmett was taken; and he was at the sensational trial. This is his gripping coming-of-age memoir.",

She is smarter than most of the adults who try to diagnose her and smarter than her classmates in her integrated classroom?the very same classmates who dismiss her as mentally challenged, because she cannot tell them otherwise. But Melody refuses to be defined by cerebral palsy. And she?s determined to let everyone know it?somehow. In this breakthrough story?reminiscent of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?from multiple Coretta Scott King Award-winner Sharon Draper, readers will come to know a brilliant mind and a brave spirit who will change forever how they look at anyone with a disability.",

Jimmie's beautiful voice inspires him to leave the camp to be a performer, while Deza and Mother find a new home, and cling to the hope that they will find Father. The twists and turns of their story reveal the devastation of the Depression and prove that Deza truly is the Mighty Miss Malone.",

Of course, Zac brushes this off as a tall tale ? until his grandfather is murdered and their apartment is completely ransacked. Clearly somebody is after something.\n\nHeeding his grandfather's dying words, Zac is off to Ghana to track down his family's history. But what did his grandfather mean when he said that Zac had the map to the treasure? Following every clue he can find, Zac begins to suspect that the treasure is real, and hidden in one of Ghana's old slave forts. Too bad the killers always seem to be one step ahead of him. With no one he can trust and with everything to lose, Zac races against time as he tries to uncover the truth about the past ? and a fortune in gold.",

She's sweet and sassy and every bit as tough as her older siblings. She sings like nobody's business; she has a pet iguana named Lady Love; her favorite color is grape-jelly purple; and when she grows up, she's going to be the most famous woman animal doctor on the planet. She's the fabulous, oh-so-spectacular Ruby Marigold Booker! \nIn Book 1, Ruby is leaving her old school and headed to a new one where nobody knows her--and where her older brothers rule. But that's about to change, because Ruby Booker has BIG plans! Although things don't go according to plan, Ruby manages to grab the spotlight when she sings a song over the P.A. system during announcements. By the time school lets out, one thing is clear: Ruby Booker isn't \"the Booker Boys' baby sis\" anymore.",

And they loved sports, especially football.\n\nThen one day Tiki badly hurt his knee in a biking accident, and he was sure he'd never be able to play again. Their mother had always told them, \"You are each other's best friends. Stick together, believe in yourselves, and you can do anything.\" They kept her words in their hearts and never gave up.",

On the final spread, the book takes a vertical twist to show the whole, laughing child. The stories are sweet and simple, and children will enjoy bending knees or wiggling toes along with the protagonists. The illustrations were sketched in graphite and painted digitally; they are warm and lively with swirls of color and friendly animals looking on. The text refers to knees \"so brown and so strong\" and toes \"so brown and sweet.\"",

  "description": "On one front, this is a novel about a sixth-grade girl's social studies project and her inability to get along with her father, but on another level it is about the much larger issue of dreams shattered and lost. In it, Boyd examines the perceptions that young people may have of the Vietnam War, as well as the impact that the war and the homefront divisiveness of the war era continue to have on families, especially those in which there are veterans. Chartreuse ``Charlie'' Pippin is an 11-year-old black girl living in Berkeley, California. Not much seems to go right for her. She is a hardworking, successful businesswoman cut from the same delightful, rebellious cloth as her grandmother, but her entrepreneurial skills cause her problems with both her father and school authorities. Her decision to learn about the Vietnam War as a school report only leads to further conflict with her father, who refuses to discuss the war. The domestic resolution is in keeping with the larger issue of the war: it is not so much a peace settlement as a cease fire.  From School Library Journal",

Intended to provide this frequently regarded \"lost generation\" of young men with words of encouragement and guidance, Harper's deep-rooted passion regarding the plight of today's youth drove him to write this book, sure to change the lives of readers for years to come.",

But nothing is what it seems, and this summer will open Perry's eyes to prejudice, temptation, and God's plans for his life-if he's willing to listen.\n\nOn his own for the first time at the nearly all-white Hilton Head, Perry's innocence is stripped away when he comes face-to-face with the ugliness of racism. Suddenly, everywhere he looks, he sees trouble: The police harass Perry for a crime he didn't commit. His dad is getting pressure at his dealership for speaking out against discrimination. The other players at Tech are jealous of their new teammate. Even Perry's dazzling skill on the football field is leading him away from God and down a path of temptation. \n\nNow, Perry has a choice-he can join the haters, or he can give the glory to God, uplift others, demonstrate the way, and make what's wrong right.",

  "description": "When a high school teacher in the Bronx begins to host open-mike poetry in his classroom on Fridays, his students find a forum to express their identity issues and forge unexpected connections with one another. Grimes's (Jazmin's Notebook) creative, contemporary premise will hook teens, and the poems may even inspire readers to try a few of their own. The poetic forms range from lyrics penned by aspiring rapper Tyrone to the concrete poem of a budding Puerto Rican painter Raul (titled \"Zorro\" and formed as the letter \"Z\"). Ultimately, though, there may be too many characters for the audience to penetrate deeply. The students in Mr. Ward's English class experience everything from dyslexia and low self-esteem to teenage motherhood and physical abuse. The narrators trade off quickly, offering only a glimpse into their lives. Not even Tyrone, who breaks in after each student's poem to offer some commentary, comes fully to life.

  "description": "14-year-old Lily Owen, neglected by her father and isolated on their South Carolina peach farm, spends hours imagining a blissful infancy when she was loved and nurtured by her mother, Deborah, whom she barely remembers. These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words \"Tiburon, South Carolina\" scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed, The Secret Life of Bees is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic.

  "description": "They share a precious gift. . . .\r\n\r\nJoining Rachel Jackson's church youth group has been a lifesaver for Camille, Alexis, Jasmine, and Angel. The fabulous four share everything from juicy gossip to mentoring school kids. But their loyalty is put to the test when two of the girls get caught up in problems of their own -- and may drag their girlfriends down with them.\r\n\r\nWill they forget who their friends are?\r\n\r\nWealthy Alexis seems to have the perfect life -- but no one can see her fear as her parents head for divorce. Meanwhile, Jasmine is tired of being the glue that holds her mother and siblings together, and she escapes by moving in with her father. Both girls are tempted to do something drastic to get the attention they crave, and both need to hear Rachel's hard-won advice on why stealing will only get them more trouble. But when it comes to winning back Camille and Angel's trust, Alexis and Jasmine will have to find the answers in their own hearts.",
