Live Heroku app url: https://powerful-brushlands-6518.herokuapp.com/wp-admin/index.php

Installation (can skip this)
------------

See [SETUP_README.md](SETUP_README.md)

Running Locally
---------------

A Vagrant instance to run Heroku WP is included. To get up and running:
* Install vagrant http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
* Install vitrual box https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
* Install virtual box extension pack https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
* `cd` into app root directory and run `$ vagrant up` (should start setting up virtual env. go grab some â˜•, takes about 10 minutes)
* `vagrant ssh` to go in the Vagrant box
* Run `composer --working-dir=/app install`

Once Vagrant provisions the VM you will have Heroku WP running locally at `http://herokuwp.local/`. On first load, it should bring you to the wordpress install page. If the site is not accessible in the browser, you might need to add `192.168.50.100  herokuwp.local` to your hosts file.

To run theme locally
----------------

* cd into the theme directory (`public/wp-content/themes/sprout-challenge`)
* run `npm install`
* run `grunt dev` to watch your changes

If your computer goes to sleep and vagrant is suspended abruptly
----------------

Sometimes after `vagrant up` from a aborted state, the vm does not start correctly and the site is not accessible. 
* Provision the machine `vagrant provision` to force it to start back up again
* Possible just try `vagrant reload` first?

Update Composer locally
----------------

If you add new plugins or upgrade versions of plugins via `composer.json` then you need to generate the `composer.lock` file with the following command locally:

* `vagrant ssh` to go in the Vagrant box
* `cd /app/` to go to the app directory in the Vagrant box
* Run `composer update --ignore-platform-reqs` to update
